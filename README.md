# Exercise

Welcome to this exercise. The objective is to provide candidates with a realistic scenario that will demonstrate their ability to:

1. Create a boilerplate codebase to start development
2. Use a DevOps first approach
3. Create pipelines
4. Automate pipelines

# Scenario: acme.com

Acme is a retail company making milions of dollars in revenue every year. Very frequently, they find demselves in need to innovate and create new application to satisfy different customars needs.

Acme has approached you for a proof of concept, please see details below.

# Requirements

1. Your solution must be hosted in a public github repo and shared with the team.
2. Create an application boilerplate code using your language of preference.
3. The application must be an API that returns some of its configurations from an endpoint.
4. The application should have a healthcheck endpoint.
5. The application must be containerized.
6. Configuration must be provided within the runtime environment.
7. The application must contain 1 or more pipelines that performs verifications on the image and/or code.
8. The application must be demonstrated as a deployment in a Kubernetes cluster.
9. [ Extra ] Create a free kubernetes cluster in a cloud environment (i.e. IBM Cloud, Digital Ocean).
10. [ Extra ] Automate the deployment of the application.
